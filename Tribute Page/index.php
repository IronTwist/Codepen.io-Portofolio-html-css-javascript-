            <div id="tribute-info">The city of Turda is situated some kilometers north of the City of Campia Turzii, at the edge of the Feleac Hills, at an altitude of 330-350 meters, on the left bank of the Aries River, nearly 30 km south-east from Cluj-Napoca, the county seat. The oldest traces of human inhabitance in the area belong to the Musterian culture of the middle Paleolithic. Archeological digs done within the current city limits have unearthed the vestiges of a Dacian settlement named Potaissa (Potabissa or Potavissa), that became, immediately after the Roman conquest of Dacia, one of the most important Roman cities and a main military center of the province of Dacia Superior, lying on the road between Apulum (today's Alba Iulia) and Porolissum (today's Moigrad village in Salaj County). Renowned geographer Ptolemy had named the city in his works as Patreuissa. The Dacian-Roman settlement that developed here after 106 was set to become one of the main urban centers of the Dacian provinces.<figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/2010-IMG_1840.jpg" alt="Ex Luteran Chearch" width="400" height="300"  style=""\><figcaption>Turda view from Above</figcaption></figure>In order to bolster the defenses of northern Dacia, the Legio V Macedonica was brought to the town in 166-167 on the orders of Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Following the economic and urban development and the increase in the number of Roman citizens of the settlement, it was granted the status of municipium, under the title found in several inscriptions. Municipium Septimium Potaissense, later achieving, on the order of Septimius Severus (193-211), the rank of colonia. The town was renowned during the Roman conquest for the salt exploitation works that existed there. Life in the settlement continued without interruption even after the Roman withdrawal (271-275). The first mention in official documents of Turda dates back to 1075 (Castrum Turda), in relation to some privileges regarding salt exploitation. In other documents dating back to 1202-1203 and 1323 there are mentions of the Turda Citadel. The first Transylvanian public assembly was held near Turda in 1238, during the time of Voivode Roland Borsa. Gradually, these meetings turned into periodic assemblies in which the nobility of the Transylvanian counties played the central role, the frequency of the meetings being twice yearly and the venue being somewhere near Turda.</div>
            <div id="tribute-info">Through the Second Vienna Award of August 30, 1940, the northeastern part of Transylvania was ceded to Hungary, that year's month of September being the date for massive protests in Turda against this act. During the Second World War, following Romania's joining of the Allies on August 23, 1944, Turda was the site of fierce battles between the Romanian and German-Hungarian armies. On September 15, 1944, the ?Roman' 14th Guards Regiment established a bridgehead over the Aries River, north of the village of Poiana. Between September 5 - October 4, 1944, the Romanian Army, through heavy fighting, managed to rebuke the German-Hungarian offense in the area. Romanian troops of the 7th and 18th Divisions made up the bulk of the fighting force, managing to free the town of Turda on October 4, 1944. 
            
            Turda was declared a city on February 17, 1968. The 2011 Census showed that the city had a population of 47,744 persons.
            
            Of the historical monuments of Turda we can recount: the ruins of an old stone citadel (the Szekler Citadel), dating back to the 12th century; the Turda Veche Fortified Church - now a reformed church - built between 1400-1494 in Gothic style, with Baroque elements being added in 1800 and a 60-meter-high Gothic tower built in 1904-1906; the Turda Noua Reformed Church, built between 1500-1504 in Gothic Syle; The Roman-Catholic Church, built in Gothic style between 1498-1504; The Monument dedicated to Michael the Brave, a work of sculptor Marius Butunoiu, inaugurated on May 8, 1977 (on the occasion of centenary celebrations of Romania's independence); the Voivodal Palace (15th-16th centuries), a Gothic and Renaissance style building that housed the sessions of the Transylvanian Diet. 
            Turda is also an important tourist center, being host to a balneal resort, treatments at the resort being recommended for rheumatic, neurologic, peripheral, cardiovascular, and skin ailments. Other tourist objectives in and near the town are the Turda Gorges, the Tureni Gorges, Baile Sarate (The Salt Baths), the Turda Saline, and the History Museum. </div>

Archaeologically speaking, however, there is a lack of material evidence for this activity. This is due to the fact that such remains, e.g. shafts and galleries, would have been destroyed by future mining activities.</div>
